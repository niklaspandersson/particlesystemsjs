# particlesystems.js
Particlesystems.js is a unopinionated, slim library for creating particle effects. It helps you by taking care of all the tedious bits of particle effects, leaving you with more time to focus on what makes your effects special, the drawing.

Configure you particlesystem by providing options for how your system, emitter and particles should behave. Provid a callback that does the actual drawing using your favorite drawing api. Congratulations, you're done!
